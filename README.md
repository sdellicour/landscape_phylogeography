Peaks and valleys of landscape phylogeography
===============

This repo gathers the input files and scripts related to our study entitled "**Peaks and valleys of landscape phylogeography**" (Dellicour *et al*. *in prep.*). R scripts used to conduct the different analytical steps summarised within the workflow figure just below are all available in `R_scripts_analyses.r`.

<span style="font-size:0.85em;">**Figure: simulation and analytical workflow implemented to assess the statistical performances of four landscape phylogeographic approaches aiming at testing the impact of environmental factors on the diffusion velocity of viral lineages or on the deviation from an isolation-by-distance pattern.** We here assessed the performance of two post hoc (isolation-by-resistance and lineage diffusion velocity analyses) and two preliminary landscape phylogeography approaches (analyses of continuous phylogeographic reconstructions based on sampling coordinates obtained either after a multidimensional scaling or cartogram transformation). Continuous phylogeographic simulations (step 1), transformations of sampling coordinates (step 2), and landscape phylogeographic analyses were conducted with the R package “[seraphim](https://github.com/sdellicour/seraphim)”, the RNA sequences simulations with the program [πBUSS](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/software/pibuss), and the continuous phylogeographic reconstructions (step 3) with the software package [BEAST X](https://beast.community/) version 1.10.5. (*) Multidimensional scaling (MDS) transformations were conducted based on environmental distances among pair of tip nodes, which were computed using either the least-cost or Circuitscape path model while either considering the environmental raster (here an elevation raster with values rescaled between 0 and 10) or a corresponding “null” raster with accessible raster cell values uniformly equal to “1” (see the study for further detail).</span>
